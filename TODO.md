* [~] Experiment with input validation
   * [ ] required function https://helm.sh/docs/howto/charts_tips_and_tricks/#using-the-required-function

    * [ ] Bind/unbind as optional install-time step
        * [ ] Single binding

* [ ] Add integration tests using KIND and a self hosted broker (minibroker/ CF overview service)
    * Benefits: automate end to end test including svcat bumps/regressions.

* [ ] Unprovisionning as chart release deletion: error case where svcat CR fail to delete

        * the last maintenance_info (e.g. available CVE and possible downtime)
        * the Osb2Helm chart generator versionning / params change
    * Q: How to publish a complete release note with history of the maintenance_info ?
        * the current OSB catalog.yml only contain the last maintenance_info
        * the helm chart repository might contain older versions
        * the helm chart generator might be provided latest version to propagate version history
        * rely on the user-provided description instead: https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_history/
